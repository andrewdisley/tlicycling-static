TLI Cycling would not exist if it were not for the team of volunteers who organise races under our rules and regulations. Therefore we aim to make all aspects of event promotion as simple and economical as possible, without compromising the safety of our competitors, while at the same time ensuring that we cause minimum disruption to other road users.

The cost of organising an event, or a series of events, under TLI Cycling rules and regulations is zero! There are no event levies to pay for any type of TLI Cycling race, be it open road, circuit or off-road. The only onus on the organiser is to inform us after the event how many competitors rode the race, and to send us a copy of the signing on sheet together with any day member fees that may have been collected. The organiser must be a full member of TLI Cycling.

The main objective of TLI Cycling is to provide age-related racing so that entrants are theoretically only competing against others of a similar ability. Therefore events are either conducted as a handicap, or within groups, split according to age. Although these groups may contain riders from several age categories, the results must be structured so that each category will have its own classification.

TLI Cycling events are open equally to male and female competitors. To allow females to compete on an equal footing TLI Cycling operates a ‘unisex’ age category system. Females are allocated a age category which for senior and veteran ladies is generally three bands above that of a male competitor of the same age. e.g. A female aged 30 to 39 is designated as a ‘C’ category and would be directly competing in the same age group as males aged 50 to 54 who are also assigned as a ‘C’ category. Organisers should therefore not have to organise female-only races or offer ‘first female’ prizes as the males against which they are directly competing are already handicapped by virtue of their greater age. Organisers should also take care not to organise events on a simple ‘Over 40’ or ‘Over 50’ basis as this may not correctly recognise the category status of female riders.

In National Championships our rules are as follows: the minimum number of entrants for a National Champion or Category Jersey to be awarded is three(3). Where there are fewer than three(3) entrants in an age category, those competitors will be eligible for “medals only” in that category.

Where an event is oversubscribed, organisers are asked to give priority entry to TLI Cycling members who belong to TLI Cycling event-promoting clubs.

Event insurance is provided for Public and Products Liability (£10,000,000); Employers Liability (£10,000,000); and Professional Indemnity (£1,000,000).
