## UPDATE ON CORONAVIRUS & RACING: FOR ALL TLI CYCLING MEMBERS & SUPPORTERS

Please read in conjunction with our previous announcement on 30th March 2020.

You may have seen that BC has recently extended their suspension of Regional racing until 1 August, and that CTT have announced that it may be possible to resume club time trials from 6 July and open events from 18 July. This is all subject to further Gov guidance for England.


This update is to let you know that TLI Cycling has no plans to resume racing at present. We believe that bunch racing will not be possible for some time yet.
However, we think that it may be possible to resume individual time trials before road races.
When the timescale for resuming time trials becomes clearer, we will support organisers who may be considering promoting road bike time trials on ‘sporting’ courses. Not on busy main roads, dual carriageways or circuits.

We will continue to monitor the situation closely and as soon as there is a significant change a further update will be posted.
We are sharing information and plans with BMCR and are grateful for their support and input which enables both organisations to work together.
We are aware that there are developments on the IoM which may lead to an earlier easing of current restrictions.

Nigel Harrop, TLI Cycling National Secretary (for & on behalf of the National Council)
