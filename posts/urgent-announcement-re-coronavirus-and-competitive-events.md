Dear TLI Cycling Member,

Given today’s updated guidelines from the UK Government and the significant changes in the transmission and infection rate of the virus, it is with sincere regret that:

**TLI Cycling is suspending all competitive events with immediate effect.**

This decision will be reviewed in two months’ time, at which point, depending on national circumstances, it will either be lifted or extended. I’m afraid that an extension looks more likely at this point in time.

I am really sorry to be the bearer of this news, especially given the quality of the 2020 Racing Programme and the massive contribution to date by our Organisers, supported by Rider HQ.

I also appreciate the time, effort and anticipation that all members will have put into getting ready for this season.

Obviously World events have overtaken all of us. Please do look out for one another, especially our older members and those with health concerns. Enjoy your cycling, preferably solo, while we are still allowed to exercise outdoors. It’s good for you!

Thank you for supporting TLI Cycling.

Kind Regards,

Nigel Harrop, National Secretary (On Behalf of the National Management Committee)
