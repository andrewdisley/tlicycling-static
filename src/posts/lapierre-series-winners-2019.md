It was a great pity that we lost events for various reasons, leaving only 4 counting races. Nonetheless they were hard fought and produced worthy winner, in some cases exceptional rides. Where riders have equal points then the most wins apply and if still equal the most 2nd places. Alan and Karl had exactly the same record.

Hereâ€™s the list of the Overall top ten and the Category winners.

To recap winners received 6 points down to 6th, 1 point except for group G/H where the points reflected to number of riders which was a maximum of 4.
