Dear TLI Cycling Member / Supporter,

At TLI Cycling we are all very much aware of, and sympathetic to, the desire and enthusiasm for many of you to return to competitive cycling.

However you will also be aware that the Social Distancing Guidance remains at 1 Mtr Plus and that the group size limit is restricted on the road. Please do not disregard this advice on social or group rides. This epidemic is far from over!

So, to look at the positives, this is what we are we doing or are proposing to do.

### The Current Position {.subtitle}
**On the Isle of Man**, in accordance with the Manx Government Guidelines, there has been a return to a full racing programme of TTs, RRs, MTB events & the Cyclefest Gran Fondo. These events are for Manx residents ONLY.

**Within the UK (England Only)** following the relaxation of the Guidelines by the UK Government we can do do the following: -

### Time Trials {.subtitle}

We will positively consider any requests to reinstate any TT events on the TLI Cycling Calendar in England.

If any road race organiser wishes to apply to run their event as a TT or, if any TLI Cycling supporting club wishes to apply to promote a new event, (Club or Open) that will be positively welcomed and considered for approval.

TLI Cycling TTs will  be approved, only if they are on relatively traffic-free sporting courses, road bikes being preferred, but with TT bikes at the organisers discretion.

Please read the guidance for TTs in the [Event Promoters Pack 2020 PDF](/u/TLICycling_Event-Promoters-Pack-2020.pdf){download} and refer to the [Time Trial Promotion & Coronavirus 2020 PDF](/u/TLICycling_COVID-TimeTrial-Promotion-Event-Guidance-2020.pdf){download} which must be followed and included with the Event Risk Assessment.

### Group Start Events {.subtitle}

(This includes Road Races, Crits, MTB, Cyclo Cross, whether on Public roads or Closed Circuits).

At this time the requirement for Social distancing makes Group Start events impractical and potentially ill-advised.

We will update this position if there are any significant changes, but Road Racing and Criteriums are very unlikely to be supported in 2020 or "Off-Road" events before the late Autumn.

Organisers willing, the intention is to repeat the very full 2020 racing programme in 2021.

All 2020 TLI Cycling National Championships will be transferred to 2021.

There will be a further update as soon as there is anything new and positive to report.

Enjoy socially distanced cycling for now and continue to Stay Safe.

Nigel Harrop, (for and on behalf of the National Management Group)
