TLI Cycling Ltd AGM Nov. 27th 2022

Chairman’s Report

*The National Committee met at Cottons Hotel, Knutsford to fulfil its legal obligations and discuss a general agenda for the 2023 season.*

It had been a difficult year and the Board of Directors have worked tirelessly to firstly take control of the ship and secondly to move the Company forward.

We now have complete control of our own destiny and for this, I would like to thank Mark Wood whose perseverance and fortitude saw us finally wrest control of our finances from the former officer and a very uncooperative bank.

Tim Ball and Ian Noons have enacted the new regime around race organisation and administration. The whole membership owes them a debt of thanks for putting us back on track.

The Managing Director, Geoff Rawlinson and I, are now endeavouring to assemble a package to assist aspiring race organisers in promoting races. This is our primary directive, this is why we exist. The programme for 2023 is filling out and we hope to announce a new season-long series of races similar to the ones, sponsored by LaPierre, which took place in 2018 and 19.

The newly modified Organisers pack can be downloaded from our website.

TLI Cycling Ltd have all the equipment available that organisers will require and our strong links with bikemarshalls.co.uk give you much less expensive access to race services.

More and more clubs/teams are turning away from the “Establishment” towards TLI Cycling, for both road races and time trials, as their service provider and combined with riderHQ, the whole gamete of organisation is simplified to an acceptable level, allowing even first timers to “put something back”.

Please don’t hesitate to contact any of the Board of Directors for assistance at any stage of a potential racing event. We can better outline the whole package available and the financial possibilities.

Please note our insurance does not extend to MPE’s \[ [Mass Participation Events] such as Sportifs or Eroica style events.

From a financial viewpoint, TLI Cycling events should \[unless you are using expensive motor racing circuits] always be self-funding, with only average entry levels providing enough revenue to produce a surplus to fund further events or other aspects of the club/team.

Membership fees remain unchanged for 2023 \[£20 for full racing licence and £10 for associates] and Race levies will be standardised to £1 per entrant per event for ALL types of races.

There will be changes to the content you can post on Facebook and we are going to set up a YouTube channel to facilitate the posting of race content videos.

Finally a vote of thanks to Rob Sorby and his team for the amazing promotion of our National Championships for 2022 on the Isle of Man. Fantastic organisation and facilities, no wonder so many stars emerge from The Rock.

I look forward to 2023 with optimism and hope to see a full calendar of races, so don't just sit there reading this...
