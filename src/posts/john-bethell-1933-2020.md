It is with great sadness I have to report the news of John Bethell’s passing.

John was a key figure in the development and success of “The League International” (TLI) and part of the team who managed the change to the organisation we now call TLI Cycling. He occupied senior roles in both organisations for many years.

John was a proud member of Macclesfield Wheelers, an outstanding Roadman and keen Cyclo-cross rider.

He has made an outstanding contribution to the TLI, both League and Cycling, and to cycle-sport in it’s widest sense. He will be greatly missed by all who knew him.

Thank-you for all you have done John.

Our love and condolences go to his wife Brenda, and all the members of the family.

More to follow when known.

Nigel Harrop, National Secretary
