All the content on this National Website has been updated for 2021/22, including the Promoters Pack, Contacts and Downloads.

So, as soon as the Covid crisis shows any sign of subsiding, hopefully by May(?), we're all ready to go with grouped-start racing on the UK Mainland. 

We'd like to invite all organisers to send Event Applications to their Region Rep (or Event Coordinator) and to post the event on RiderHQ for approval.

Our range of excellent insurance cover for members, organisers, officials, & marshals and has now been agreed with the Brokers and will be renewed for [1st January 2021](x-apple-data-detectors://0).

Membership Renewal, rejoining, or membership for new members, is already available, runs [until 28/02/2022](x-apple-data-detectors://1). and for Junior/Senior members includes Third Party Liability indemnity (Up to £10M) for training, except commuting, as well as racing . 

Youth Members (who all receive FREE membership), are covered for participation in TLI Cycling events.

As far as it's possible to do so, have a great Christmas and New Year, from all at TLI Cycling.
