To All TLI Cycling Members,

Given the seriousness and uncertainty surrounding the spread and progression within the UK of the Coronavirus Pandemic, all TLI Cycling Competitive Events are cancelled until further notice. There is unlikely to be any resumption of racing in the 2020 season.

If you are a TLI Cycling Junior Category Member, or Older (NOT Youth members), you continue to have Third Party Indemnity while cycling is allowed.

Should you choose to continue to use your bike, please ensure that you comply with all the current UK Government Guidance in force at that time.

You must ride SOLO, unless with other members of your household, and undertake only ONE exercise session per day in order to help maintain your health / immunity.

Strictly observe the Social Distancing 2 Mtr / 6 Feet rule when encountering walkers, runners and other cyclists.

Donâ€™t forget to acknowledge others with a wave or friendly greeting!

Do be aware of any expectations regarding duration or distance and the possibility that guidance may become even more restrictive.

I will shortly update organisers with guidance regarding the transfer of our events on Rider HQ from 2020 to the 2021 season.

Look after your health and that of others.

Best wishes,

Nigel Harrop, National Secretary. (For and on behalf of the National Management Team)
