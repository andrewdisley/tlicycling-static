Similarly, faster riders may compete with a younger group, subject to the organiser’s agreement, if they require more competition.

Anyone riding “out of category” will not be shown in the published results on the TLI Cycling website, nor are they eligible for any prize(s).

In National Championship events, all entrants must compete in their correct category.

Organisers must not allow category changes to enable an individual to ride in the same race as their teammates.

### 2.3 Membership of other cycling bodies
Membership of other cycling bodies does not bar participation in TLI Cycling events.

### 2.4 All competitors wishing to enter a race:
on the day of the event must present themselves to Race Control with the correct and fully completed Entry Form, at least 45 minutes before the start. All pre-entered riders must be signed-on by 30 minutes before the start, after which time Reserves may sign on and be allocated to fill any vacancies, up to the maximum permitted number of competitors.

### 2.5 Cycles used for road or circuit racing:
shall be fitted with a freewheel and two independent brakes in good working order and, with the exception of races for U8, U10, U12 and U14 categories, only the traditional type of ‘drop’ handlebars may be used. Fixed extensions, such as tri bars, are not permitted in group-start events. It is the responsibility of the competitor and/or the parent or guardian in the case of under 18s, to ensure that for every race held under these regulations his/her cycle is in a safe condition.

### 2.6 Race clothing:

### 2.12 In events with multiple races:
for different age groups, when a slower race is caught and passed by a faster race, the slower race shall allow the faster race to establish it self separately in front of the slower race.It is not permitted for riders from the slower race to gain advantage by joining the faster moving race. This applies equally to breaks and lone riders.If a break from a faster race catches groups of riders from a slower race, the caught riders may not join in or contribute in any way to the break or do anything else that affects the course of that race.

### 2.13 Disciplinary action:
will be taken against any member who is found to be interfering with or participating in a race without having officially entered or signed on for that race.

### 2.14 Procedure for cases of Unacceptable Riding or Behaviour by Members:
any member who, in the opinion of a National Council Disciplinary Panel, acts in a way that is contrary to the ethos of TLI Cycling, is likely to be suspended or permanently disqualified from membership. 
### Stage One – 
Any complaint of unacceptable behaviour or dangerous riding made by other riders, race helpers or members of the public should be directed to the Race Organiser. The organiser will gather views and evidence from as many members and helpers present as possible, including the subject of the complaint. If the complaint seems to be well founded, the organiser will warn the subject of the complaint that the incident will be investigated and action may be taken. If the organiser considers it a minor incident, they may take immediate action, such as disqualification from the race, or a warning, or take the complaint no further. 
### Stage Two – 
If the event organiser considers it a serious case they will inform their Regional Representative(s) on the National Council about the incident and share the information they have gathered. If the Regional Representative(s) agree that it is serious case and requires action, they will nominate a panel of three National Council members to consider the case. The panel will gather any additional information they deem necessary, and contact the subject to ask for his/her account of the incident. The panel will discuss the case (by email or phone if they cannot meet) and inform the subject of their decision by post. 
### Stage Three – 
the subject of the complaint may appeal against any sanction to the National secretary of TLI Cycling who will convene a further panel of three National Council members. The decision of any second panel will be final. TLI Cycling will observe and apply any sanctions imposed The BMCR, CTT or BC.

## (3) Event Promotion

### 3.1 Event Promotion
All promotional material concerning events must include the words: “Under The Rules and Regulations of TLI Cycling”.

### 3.2 Race Organisers
Race Organisers must complete a Race Application Form, which should then be forwarded to the Region Representative / Event Coordinator of the Region where the Race will take place. The Region Representative / Event Coordinator will enter event details on the race calendar of the TLI Cycling website. Approval may be refused by the Region Representative / Event Coordinator who will, if challenged, justify this action to the National Council via the National Secretary.

### 3.3 No event may be styled
No event may be styled as a WORLD, EUROPEAN, OR NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP, or use the name TLI Cycling, as an event title, without the prior approval of the National Council.

### 3.4 All Races on public roads
All Races on public roads are governed by the CYCLE RACING ON THE HIGHWAYS REGULATIONS 1960 and any subsequent amendment regulations, or any variations which may apply in Wales or Scotland.

### 3.5 Race organisers
Race organisers must use the approved ‘STANDARD REGISTRATION SHEET’ without any alteration to the text for signing-on at all events.

### 3.6 TLI Cycling will invite:
the promotion of a National Road Race and Closed Circuit Championships for every age category which will be open only to full members. Competitors must ride in their correct age related group. National Championship Jerseys and medals will be awarded to each category as described below
### The Championship Jerseys:
are to be White with Red, White and Blue, bands, with the TLI Cycling Logo integrated into the design. Sponsors names may also be shown on the Jerseys.
National Championships, in disciplines other than Road Racing, may be promoted if approved by the National Council.

All National Championship events will be promoted on the understanding that the event organiser bears the full costs of the event

There will be a separate “WJ” National Championship for Female Juniors. The WJ group will ride with one of the older age-related categories. This category may be used by organisers in any TLI Cycling event.

In TLI Cycling National Road Race Championships and in other TLI Cycling National Championships where Category Jerseys and Medals are presented, the minimum number of entrants for a National Champion or Category Jersey to be awarded is three (3). Where there are fewer than three (3) entrants in an age category, those competitors will be eligible for “medals only” in that category.

At the National Circuit Race Championships, Female Youth category entrants will be eligible for Jerseys and / or medals as described above.

### 3.7 The format of Races
The format of Races other than the National Championships **(see Rule 3.6)** is generally left to the Organisers of such Races. However: –

A) Whilst it is understood that the number of entries per category, or circuit length, may determine the format, the aim is to maximise the enjoyment of the age-related racing experience.

This will lead to two or three consecutive age related races, separated by a few minutes, or a Handicap style of event.

B) Organisers are encouraged to apply the principle of “one rider-one prize”

Allocation to groups in a Handicap event should be on an age-related basis.

C) Results should be entered on the TLI Cycling Facebook page and show the age-related category of each finisher. Where a Start Sheet has been produced, then each competitor’s name must have his/her age-related category shown alongside.


### 3.8 Race Field Selection

Race Field Selection – For all road and closed circuit races, organisers will consider entries from 6 weeks before the date of the event (or first event in a Series).

If the event is oversubscribed, entries will close no earlier than 3 weeks before the date of the first race for the selection to take place. In this case the organiser should:

Firstly, give preference to members from clubs, sponsored teams or to groups of individuals, which are promoting TLI Cycling events in the current year.

Secondly, give preference to clubs which are promoting events for the BMCR in the current year.

**E.g: –**

Maximum Number of Entrants permitted on public roads at any one time is 80 (1960 Racing on the Highway Regs), unless the organiser has requested, and the Police have granted, “Special Permission” under the “1960 Regs and Subsequent Amendments”. Please note: Wales and Scotland operate under different Regs to England.

For a “closed circuit race”, not on public roads, the maximum number of competitors will be determined by the organiser’s Risk Assessment for the course.

Allocate the entrants to 2, preferably 3, Age-Related Races.

Maximum of 40 competitors in any one race on public roads, unless a handicap format is used. (TLI Cycling good practice to minimise accidents or inconvenience).

Check that the correct Age-Related TLI Cycling Categories have been allocated.

Check that Female Entrants are in their correct category, as shown on their licence.

Therefore, the number of entries to return is xx

**Rejection Criteria: –**

Prioritise the TLI Cycling event-promoting clubs in the current year.

If the event is oversubscribed with TLI Cycling “event promoting clubs” entrants, the following will apply:-

* Identify teams of 4 or more and select 3 only or, if necessary fewer and so on, to achieve the statutory number of competitors, not including reserves. Allocate any remaining places to other TLI Cycling members then:
* Prioritise the current year’s BMCR event promoting clubs (where known), using the above criteria, to achieve the maximum number of competitors allowed, plus reserves.

### 3.9 Race Organisers
Race Organisers are responsible for the initial liaison with the Police and any Safety Advisory Groups. The Organiser must hold a copy of all correspondence with these authorities on the event file. It is a requirement that the file is taken to the event HQ on the day of the event to answer questions from the Police or other such officials who may be in attendance.

### 3.10 Series Coordinator
Any set of events organised as a Series must have an identified Series Coordinator who will be ultimately responsible for the administration and smooth running of all the events.

Organisers are responsible for arranging a set of Competent Officials and Race Marshals for the duration of the race. These Officials should include a Steward in control of signing-on the riders prior to the start, and Judges for the race finish. The Organiser may appoint a Race Controller/Safety Officer, to assist with the race management, with delegated power to make decisions. The identity of such a person should be made known to the Police on request.

* Whether an ambulance or other emergency vehicles will require access to the location road and create a necessary obstruction.
* The visibility for competitors and other road users at the scene of the accident / incident.
* Any other relevant factors, such as queueing traffic, the risk to passing competitors or public and whether or not the race will pass the accident / incident again.
