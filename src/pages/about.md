# About TLI Cycling {.pretitle}

## Age-Related Cycle Sport For All {.title}

Supporting Grassroots Cycle Racing for 35 Years {.subtitle}

TLI Cycling is a voluntary sports organisation, supporting cycling clubs in the UK, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man, to organise competitive cycling events for all ages, entrants racing against others in their peer group. It is run on a not-for-profit basis entirely by unpaid volunteer members, any surplus being used to maintain, improve and develop TLI Cycling’s activities.

TLI Cycling has for over 35 years provided grass-roots cycle racing for all ages and abilities, with competition based upon age. In 2018 we accommodated over 10,000 male and female entrants in our various events, the competitors ranging in age from 6 to over 75!

The aim of TLI Cycling is to encourage cyclists in the UK to ‘have a go’ at cycle racing in any of its forms. Whether you are a complete novice or an ex-professional, male or female, we welcome your participation in our events. Your age determines your category, so that although races may contain riders from several age groups, the results will be structured where possible so that each category will have its own classification based upon your age. To allow females to compete on an equal footing TLI Cycling operates a ‘unisex’ age category system. Females are allocated an age category which for senior and veteran ladies is generally three bands above that of a male competitor of the same age.
