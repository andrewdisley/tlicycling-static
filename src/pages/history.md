# History of TLI Cycling {.title}

TLI Cycling evolved from The League International, formed in 1982 from an idea conceived by the late Peter Duker and Roy Cottingham. They had the ambition of bringing to Great Britain age-related, as practised by the European based International Cycling Federation who used this system to cater for riders of all ages.

A programme of events was established with the emphasis on providing racing for riders who, due to limited experience, ability, age, or training time, were not catered for by others. Competitors, if they had problems competing with their peers, could be reclassified into an older group than their age would normally dictate.

TLI Cycling promotions include road races, time trials, cyclo-cross, mountain bike races and cycle speedway. Our affiliation to the International Cycling Federation means we have access to events in the whole of Mainland Europe.

In 2010 TLI Cycling was amalgamated into TLI Cycling Ltd, a Company Limited By Guarantee, which provides security for all our members from possible unlimited litigation, and which in this compensation-culture world, safeguards us all against possible problems caused by other road users.
